# Fire analysis scripts for GEE

This respository contains Google Earth Engine scripts for various analyses of fires in different ecosystems.
Please see the dedicated ``README.md`` for each script.

The repository, as well as the scripts themselves, will be updated with new functionalities.

### Overview of the scripts:

- ``calculate_dNBR``: Calculate difference Normalized Burn Ration to assess burn severity
- ``detect_fires``: Get Sentinel-2 time-series NBR+ values for an area to detect fires that have occured in the past
